Links pointing to other pages of the same website will have a relative path, 
which does not include the domain (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value. 
Because the link is pointing to another page on the same website, the href attribute value
 needs to include only the filename of the page being linked to: about.html, for example.

Should the page being linked to reside within a different directory, or folder, the href
 attribute value needs to reflect this as well. Say the about.html page resides within the 
 pages directory; the relative path would then be pages/about.html.


 Both the <article> and <section> elements contribute to a document’s structure and help
     to outline a document. If the content is being grouped solely for styling purposes 
     and doesn’t provide value to the outline of a document, use the <div> element.

    If the content adds to the document outline and it can be independently redistributed
     or syndicated, use the <article> element.
    
    If the content adds to the document outline and represents a thematic group of content, 
    use the <section> element.


        To trigger the action of opening a link in a new window, use the target attribute 
        with a value of _blank. The target attribute determines exactly where the link will 
        be displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window.
